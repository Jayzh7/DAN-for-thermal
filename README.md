# DAN for thermal #
This was forked from Deep Alignment Network ([DAN])(https://github.com/MarekKowalski/DeepAlignmentNetwork). Some scripts were added to prepare training data of thermal images from researchers at RWTH Aachen. See [here](https://www.lfb.rwth-aachen.de/bibtexupload/pdf/KCZ18h.pdf) for their published paper.

Our paper was accepted by CVPM workshop.


## demo
An example of the application of this model is as follow. No quantitative result is given as that is not our main concern. But our experience shows that it does not work well for side view faces and we are exploring solutions.

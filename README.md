# DAN for thermal #
This was forked from Deep Alignment Network [DAN](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/DeepAlignmentNetwork). Some scripts were added to prepare training data of thermal images from researchers at RWTH Aachen. See [here](https://www.lfb.rwth-aachen.de/bibtexupload/pdf/KCZ18h.pdf) for their published paper.

Our paper was submitted for CVPM workshop and is under review (3/25/2020).
